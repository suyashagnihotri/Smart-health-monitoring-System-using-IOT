# Smart-health-monitoring-System-using-IOT
The Smart Health Monitoring System is an IoT-based solution that measures heart rate, SpO₂, and body temperature using an Arduino Nano with MAX30100 and LM35 sensors. Data is sent via serial communication to a NodeMCU (ESP8266), which hosts a wireless dashboard for real-time health monitoring.
